Using the diff command from terminal made it a lot easier to spot differences in source code, rather than looking line by line.

diff -u file_one file_two

Having easy access to old files could save a lot of time restoring an older, working version. Also, when changing code, I often times comment things in and out to experiment with different code structures. With version control, I could have the confidence to make changes more quickly and avoid the use of large amounts of comments that need to be removed later on.

Pros and Cons of Manual versus Automatic commits
	Pros
		- More logical seperation
		- Keeping the amount of change per commit the right size

	Cons
		- Introduction of user error ie forgetting to save

Multi-File Commits
	Some version control systems like Git save multiple files in one commit because each of the files are linked together.

Using git to view history
	git log and git diff can be used to find different commits and compare the changes between them

Confidence from version control
	- Version control gives you the ability to make changes knowing that you will have a saved state that you can revert back to should you make a mistake.
